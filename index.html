    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">When securing a website from web security attacks there are many different things you can do to ensure that your website will be protected against malicious attacks like cross-site scripting or SQL injections. Some of the things you can do to protect your website includes sanitization of your data. This will check if the data that has beeen accepted onto your website has the same format. Having secure authentication for when people log in etc. is also very useful. This way it's more difficult for malicious attacks to crack the authentication. It's also recommended that a website uses an open standard authorization protocol like OneLogin that we use for Noroff. Using a CI/CD tool to analyze changes in your code and flagging the changes that it rejects is also a good way to secure your website. And lastly, making sure the data on your website is protected when it's sent through networks is also crucial. There are also many other smaller ways to secure a website. Some examples are to implement an automatic user timeout, or to only store some parts of sensitive information (for example only the last 4 digits of a credit card if the customer can add his/her credit card information on the website. They would only need the last 4 digits to identify that it's their card)</p>
